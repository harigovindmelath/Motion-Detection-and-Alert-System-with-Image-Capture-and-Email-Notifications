# Motion-Detection-and-Alert-System-with-Image-Capture-and-Email-Notifications
This Python project implements a real-time motion detection system using OpenCV. It captures video from a webcam, detects significant motion, and sends an email alert with an image of the detected motion. The program also includes functionality to clean up captured images after processing.
